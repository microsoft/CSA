This repository links together repositories developed by CSAs to help drive knowledge sharing and improve deliveries. 

## Repositories

### ARM Templates
There are two parts to the environments deployed through these repositories:

1. [Nested Templates]()  
This will hold all the base templates that the "Scenerio Deployments" will utilize.  

2. Scenerio Deployments  
Each of these deployments will deploy a fully functional environment with zero touch.  
-- [AKS Deployments]()  
-- [App Service Deployments]()
