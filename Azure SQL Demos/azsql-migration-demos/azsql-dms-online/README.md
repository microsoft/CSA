Tutorial: Migrate SQL Server to a single database or pooled database in Azure SQL Database online using DMS
===========================================================================================================

You can use the Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the
databases from a SQL Server instance to [Azure SQL
Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/) with minimal
downtime. In this tutorial, you migrate
the **Adventureworks2012** database restored to an on-premises instance
of SQL Server 2016 (or later) to a single database or pooled database in
Azure SQL Database by using the Azure Database Migration Service.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

\[!div class=\"checklist\"\]

-   Assess your on-premises database by using the Data Migration
    Assistant.

-   Migrate the sample schema by using the Data Migration Assistant.

-   Create an instance of the Azure Database Migration Service.

-   Create a migration project by using the Azure Database Migration
    Service.

-   Run the migration.

-   Monitor the migration.

-   Download a migration report.

\[!NOTE\] Using the Azure Database Migration Service to perform an
online migration requires creating an instance based on the Premium
pricing tier. For more information, see the Azure Database Migration
Service [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/database-migration/) page.

\[!IMPORTANT\] For an optimal migration experience, Microsoft recommends
creating an instance of the Azure Database Migration Service in the same
Azure region as the target database. Moving data across regions or
geographies can slow down the migration process and introduce errors.

This article describes an online migration from SQL Server to a single
database or pooled database in Azure SQL Database. For an offline
migration, see [Migrate SQL Server to Azure SQL Database offline using
DMS](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/dms/tutorial-sql-server-to-azure-sql.md).

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial, you need to:

-   Download and install [SQL Server 2012 or
    later](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).

-   Enable the TCP/IP protocol, which is disabled by default during SQL
    Server Express installation, by following the instructions in the
    article [Enable or Disable a Server Network
    Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol#SSMSProcedure).

-   Create a single (or pooled) database in Azure SQL Database, which
    you do by following the detail in the article [Create a single
    database in Azure SQL Database using the Azure
    portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-single-database-get-started).

> \[!NOTE\] If you use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and want
> to migrate the catalog database for your SSIS projects/packages
> (SSISDB) from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database, the destination SSISDB
> will be created and managed automatically on your behalf when you
> provision SSIS in Azure Data Factory (ADF). For more information about
> migrating SSIS packages, see the article [Migrate SQL Server
> Integration Services packages to
> Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/how-to-migrate-ssis-packages).

-   Download and install the [Data Migration
    Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53595) (DMA)
    v3.3 or later.

-   Create a Microsoft Azure Virtual Network for the Azure Database
    Migration Service by using the Azure Resource Manager deployment
    model, which provides site-to-site connectivity to your on-premises
    source servers by using
    either [ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways).
    For more information about creating a virtual network, see
    the [Virtual Network
    Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/),
    and especially the quickstart articles with step-by-step details.

> \[!NOTE\] During virtual network setup, if you use ExpressRoute with
> network peering to Microsoft, add the following
> service [endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview) to
> the subnet in which the service will be provisioned:

-   Target database endpoint (for example, SQL endpoint, Cosmos DB
    endpoint, and so on)

-   Storage endpoint

-   Service bus endpoint

> This configuration is necessary because the Azure Database Migration
> Service lacks internet connectivity.

-   Ensure that your virtual network Network Security Group rules don\'t
    block the following inbound communication ports to Azure Database
    Migration Service: 443, 53, 9354, 445, 12000. For more detail on
    Azure Virtual Network NSG traffic filtering, see the article [Filter
    network traffic with network security
    groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg).

-   Configure your [Windows Firewall for database engine
    access](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-windows-firewall-for-database-engine-access).

-   Open your Windows firewall to allow the Azure Database Migration
    Service to access the source SQL Server, which by default is TCP
    port 1433.

-   If you\'re running multiple named SQL Server instances using dynamic
    ports, you may wish to enable the SQL Browser Service and allow
    access to UDP port 1434 through your firewalls so that the Azure
    Database Migration Service can connect to a named instance on your
    source server.

-   When using a firewall appliance in front of your source database(s),
    you may need to add firewall rules to allow the Azure Database
    Migration Service to access the source database(s) for migration.

-   Create a server-level [firewall
    rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure) for
    Azure SQL Database to allow the Azure Database Migration Service
    access to the target databases. Provide the subnet range of the
    virtual network used for the Azure Database Migration Service.

-   Ensure that the credentials used to connect to source SQL Server
    instance have [CONTROL
    SERVER](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/grant-server-permissions-transact-sql) permissions.

-   Ensure that the credentials used to connect to the target Azure SQL
    Database instance have CONTROL DATABASE permission on the target
    Azure SQL Database instances.

-   The source SQL Server version must be SQL Server 2005 and above. To
    determine the version that you SQL Server instance is running, see
    the article [How to determine the version, edition, and update level
    of SQL Server and its
    components](https://support.microsoft.com/help/321185/how-to-determine-the-version-edition-and-update-level-of-sql-server-an).

-   Database(s) must be in either Bulk-logged or Full recovery mode. To
    determine the recovery model configured for your SQL Server
    instance, see the article [View or Change the Recovery Model of a
    Database (SQL
    Server)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/view-or-change-the-recovery-model-of-a-database-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017).

-   Make sure to take the Full database backups for the databases. To
    create a Full database backup, see the article [How to: Create a
    Full Database Backup
    (Transact-SQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008-r2/ms191304(v=sql.105)).

-   If any of the tables don\'t have a primary key, enable Change Data
    Capture (CDC) on the database and specific table(s).

> \[!NOTE\] You can use the script below to find any tables that do not
> have primary keys.
>
> USE \<DBName\>;
>
> go
>
> SELECT is\_tracked\_by\_cdc, name AS TableName
>
> FROM sys.tables WHERE type = \'U\' and is\_ms\_shipped = 0 AND
>
> OBJECTPROPERTY(OBJECT\_ID, \'TableHasPrimaryKey\') = 0;
>
> If the results show one or more tables with \'is\_tracked\_by\_cdc\'
> as \'0\', enable change capture for the database and for the specific
> tables by using the process described in the article [Enable and
> Disable Change Data Capture (SQL
> Server)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/enable-and-disable-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017).

-   Configure the distributor role for source SQL Server.

> \[!NOTE\] You can determine if replication components are installed by
> using the query below.
>
> USE master;
>
> DECLARE \@installed int;
>
> EXEC \@installed = sys.sp\_MS\_replication\_installed;
>
> SELECT \@installed as installed;
>
> If the result returns an error message suggesting to install
> replication components, install SQL Server replication components by
> using the process in the article [Install SQL Server
> replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-replication?view=sql-server-2017).
>
> If the replication is already installed, check if the distribution
> role is configured on the source SQL Server using the T-SQL command
> below.
>
> EXEC sp\_get\_distributor;
>
> If the distribution isn\'t set up, where the distribution server shows
> NULL for above command output, configure the distribution using the
> guidance provided in the article [Configure
> Distribution](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/replication/configure-publishing-and-distribution?view=sql-server-2017).

-   Disable database triggers on the target Azure SQL Database.

> \[!NOTE\] You can find the database triggers on the target Azure SQL
> Database by using the following query:
>
> Use \<Database name\>
>
> select \* from sys.triggers
>
> DISABLE TRIGGER (Transact-SQL)
>
> For more information, see the article [DISABLE TRIGGER
> (Transact-SQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/disable-trigger-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017).

Assess your on-premises database
--------------------------------

Before you can migrate data from a SQL Server instance to Azure SQL
Database, you need to assess the SQL Server database for any blocking
issues that might prevent migration. Using the Data Migration Assistant
v3.3 or later, follow the steps described in the article [Performing a
SQL Server migration
assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-assesssqlonprem) to
complete the on-premises database assessment.

To assess an on-premises database, perform the following steps:

1.  In DMA, select the New (+) icon, and then select
    the **Assessment** project type.

2.  Specify a project name, in the **Source server type** text box,
    select **SQL Server**, in the **Target server type** text box,
    select **Azure SQL Database**, and then select **Create** to create
    the project.

> When you\'re assessing the source SQL Server database migrating to a
> single database or pooled database in Azure SQL Database, you can
> choose one or both of the following assessment report types:

-   Check database compatibility

-   Check feature parity

> Both report types are selected by default.

3.  In DMA, on the **Options** screen, select **Next**.

4.  On the **Select sources** screen, in the **Connect to a
    server** dialog box, provide the connection details to your SQL
    Server, and then select **Connect**.

5.  In the **Add sources** dialog box, select **AdventureWorks2012**,
    select **Add**, and then select **Start Assessment**.

> \[!NOTE\] If you use SSIS, DMA does not currently support the
> assessment of the source SSISDB. However, SSIS projects/packages will
> be assessed/validated as they are redeployed to the destination SSISDB
> hosted by Azure SQL Database. For more information about migrating
> SSIS packages, see the article [Migrate SQL Server Integration
> Services packages to
> Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/how-to-migrate-ssis-packages).
>
> When the assessment is complete, the results display as shown in the
> following graphic:
>
> ![Assess data migration](.//media/image1.png){width="6.5in"
> height="3.279861111111111in"}
>
> For single databases or pooled databases in Azure SQL Database, the
> assessments identify feature parity issues and migration blocking
> issues for deploying to a single database or pooled database.

-   The **SQL Server feature parity** category provides a comprehensive
    set of recommendations, alternative approaches available in Azure,
    and mitigating steps to help you plan the effort into your migration
    projects.

-   The **Compatibility issues** category identifies partially supported
    or unsupported features that reflect compatibility issues that might
    block migrating SQL Server database(s) to Azure SQL Database.
    Recommendations are also provided to help you address those issues.

6.  Review the assessment results for migration blocking issues and
    feature parity issues by selecting the specific options.

Migrate the sample schema
-------------------------

After you\'re comfortable with the assessment and satisfied that the
selected database is a viable candidate for migration to a single
database or pooled database in Azure SQL Database, use DMA to migrate
the schema to Azure SQL Database.

\[!NOTE\] Before you create a migration project in DMA, be sure that you
have already provisioned an Azure SQL database as mentioned in the
prerequisites. For purposes of this tutorial, the name of the Azure SQL
Database is assumed to be **AdventureWorksAzure**, but you can provide
whatever name you wish.

\[!IMPORTANT\] If you use SSIS, DMA does not currently support the
migration of source SSISDB, but you can redeploy your SSIS
projects/packages to the destination SSISDB hosted by Azure SQL
Database. For more information about migrating SSIS packages, see the
article [Migrate SQL Server Integration Services packages to
Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/how-to-migrate-ssis-packages).
