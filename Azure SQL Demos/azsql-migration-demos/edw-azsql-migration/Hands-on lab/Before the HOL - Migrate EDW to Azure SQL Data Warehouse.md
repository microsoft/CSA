# Migrate EDW to Azure SQL Data Warehouse before the hands-on lab set up guide

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription

## Before the hands-on lab

In this exercise, you will deploy the source environment for this lab. The source environment is designed to represent the existing on-premises environment you will migrate to Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

### Task 1: Deploy the source environment

1.  Browse to the Azure Portal at <https://portal.azure.com> and verify that you are logged in with the subscription that you wish to use for this lab.

2.  Select the **Deploy to Azure** button below.

3. This will launch a template deployment in the Azure Portal. Under the Resource Group parameter select **Create New** and type **CohoOnPremEnvironment** and select **OK**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Custom deployment blade, next to Resouce Group, the Create new link is highlighted and in the resulting new resource group window OnPremEnvironment is typed into the name field.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-MigrateEDWtoAzureSQLDataWarehouseimages/media/2019-01-22-19-25-46.png "Custom deployment blade")

4. Set the **Location** and the **Region** to a region close to you, accept the terms and conditions at the bottom, then select **Purchase**.

5. The deployment will take about 15-20 minutes.

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
