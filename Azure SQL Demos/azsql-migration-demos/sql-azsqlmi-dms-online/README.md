**Tutorial: Migrate SQL Server to an Azure SQL Managed Instance online
using DMS**

You can use Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the databases
from a SQL Server instance to an [Azure SQL Managed
Instance](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/azure-sql/managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview.md) with
minimal downtime. For additional methods that may require some manual
effort, see the article [SQL Server instance migration to Azure SQL
Managed
Instance](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/azure-sql/managed-instance/migrate-to-instance-from-sql-server.md).

In this tutorial, you migrate the **Adventureworks2012** database from
an on-premises instance of SQL Server to a SQL Managed Instance with
minimal downtime by using Azure Database Migration Service.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

-   Create an instance of Azure Database Migration Service.

-   Create a migration project and start online migration by using Azure
    Database Migration Service.

-   Monitor the migration.

-   Perform the migration cutover when you are ready.

\[IMPORTANT\] For online migrations from SQL Server to SQL Managed
Instance using Azure Database Migration Service, you must provide the
full database backup and subsequent log backups in the SMB network share
that the service can use to migrate your databases. Azure Database
Migration Service does not initiate any backups, and instead uses
existing backups, which you may already have as part of your disaster
recovery plan, for the migration. Be sure that you take [backups using
the WITH CHECKSUM
option](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/enable-or-disable-backup-checksums-during-backup-or-restore-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017).
Also, make sure not to append multiple backups (i.e. full and t-log)
into a single backup media; take each backup on a separate backup file.
Finally, you can use compressed backups to reduce the likelihood of
experiencing potential issues associated with migrating large backups.

\[NOTE\] Using Azure Database Migration Service to perform an online
migration requires creating an instance based on the Premium pricing
tier.

\[IMPORTANT\] For an optimal migration experience, Microsoft recommends
creating an instance of Azure Database Migration Service in the same
Azure region as the target database. Moving data across regions or
geographies can slow down the migration process and introduce errors.

\[IMPORTANT\] Reduce the duration of the online migration process as
much as possible to minimize the risk of interruption caused by instance
reconfiguration or planned maintenance. In case of such an event,
migration process will start from the beginning. In case of planned
maintenance, there is a grace period of 36 hours before migration
process is restarted.

This article describes an online migration from SQL Server to a SQL
Managed Instance. For an offline migration, see [Migrate SQL Server to a
SQL Managed Instance offline using
DMS](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/dms/tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance.md).

**Prerequisites**

To complete this tutorial, you need to:

-   Create a Microsoft Azure Virtual Network for Azure Database
    Migration Service by using the Azure Resource Manager deployment
    model, which provides site-to-site connectivity to your on-premises
    source servers by using
    either [ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways). [Learn
    network topologies for SQL Managed Instance migrations using Azure
    Database Migration Service](https://aka.ms/dmsnetworkformi). For
    more information about creating a virtual network, see the [Virtual
    Network
    Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/),
    and especially the quickstart articles with step-by-step details.

> \[NOTE\] During virtual network setup, if you use ExpressRoute with
> network peering to Microsoft, add the following
> service [endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview) to
> the subnet in which the service will be provisioned:

-   Target database endpoint (for example, SQL endpoint, Cosmos DB
    endpoint, and so on)

-   Storage endpoint

-   Service bus endpoint

> This configuration is necessary because Azure Database Migration
> Service lacks internet connectivity.
>
> If you don't have site-to-site connectivity between the on-premises
> network and Azure or if there is limited site-to-site connectivity
> bandwidth, consider using Azure Database Migration Service in hybrid
> mode (Preview). Hybrid mode leverages an on-premises migration worker
> together with an instance of Azure Database Migration Service running
> in the cloud. To create an instance of Azure Database Migration
> Service in hybrid mode, see the article [Create an instance of Azure
> Database Migration Service in hybrid mode using the Azure
> portal](https://aka.ms/dms-hybrid-create).
>
> \[IMPORTANT\] Regarding the storage account used as part of the
> migration, you must either:

-   Choose to allow all network to access the storage account.

-   Turn on [subnet
    delegation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/manage-subnet-delegation) on
    MI subnet and update the Storage Account firewall rules to allow
    this subnet.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Ensure that your virtual network Network Security Group rules don\'t
    block the following inbound communication ports to Azure Database
    Migration Service: 443, 53, 9354, 445, 12000. For more detail on
    virtual network NSG traffic filtering, see the article [Filter
    network traffic with network security
    groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg).

-   Configure your [Windows Firewall for source database engine
    access](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-windows-firewall-for-database-engine-access).

-   Open your Windows Firewall to allow Azure Database Migration Service
    to access the source SQL Server, which by default is TCP port 1433.

-   If you\'re running multiple named SQL Server instances using dynamic
    ports, you may wish to enable the SQL Browser Service and allow
    access to UDP port 1434 through your firewalls so that Azure
    Database Migration Service can connect to a named instance on your
    source server.

-   If you\'re using a firewall appliance in front of your source
    databases, you may need to add firewall rules to allow Azure
    Database Migration Service to access the source database(s) for
    migration, as well as files via SMB port 445.

-   Create a SQL Managed Instance by following the detail in the
    article [Create a SQL Managed Instance in the Azure
    portal](https://aka.ms/sqldbmi).

-   Ensure that the logins used to connect the source SQL Server and the
    target managed instance are members of the sysadmin server role.

-   Provide an SMB network share that contains all your database full
    database backup files and subsequent transaction log backup files,
    which Azure Database Migration Service can use for database
    migration.

-   Ensure that the service account running the source SQL Server
    instance has write privileges on the network share that you created
    and that the computer account for the source server has read/write
    access to the same share.

-   Make a note of a Windows user (and password) that has full control
    privilege on the network share that you previously created. Azure
    Database Migration Service impersonates the user credential to
    upload the backup files to Azure Storage container for restore
    operation.

-   Create an Azure Active Directory Application ID that generates the
    Application ID key that Azure Database Migration Service can use to
    connect to target Azure Database managed instance and Azure Storage
    Container. For more information, see the article [Use portal to
    create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal
    that can access
    resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal).

> \[NOTE\] Azure Database Migration Service requires the Contributor
> permission on the subscription for the specified Application ID.
> Alternatively, you can create custom roles that grant the specific
> permissions that Azure Database Migration Service requires. For
> step-by-step guidance about using custom roles, see the
> article [Custom roles for SQL Server to SQL Managed Instance online
> migrations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/resource-custom-roles-sql-db-managed-instance).

-   Create or make a note of **Standard Performance tier**, Azure
    Storage Account, that allows DMS service to upload the database
    backup files to and use for migrating databases. Make sure to create
    the Azure Storage Account in the same region as the Azure Database
    Migration Service instance is created.

  **SMB Network location share**                  The local SMB network share or Azure file share that contains the Full database backup files and transaction log backup files that Azure Database Migration Service can use for migration. The service account running the source SQL Server instance must have read\\write privileges on this network share. Provide an FQDN or IP addresses of the server in the network share, for example, \'\\\\servername.domainname.com\\backupfolder\' or \'\\\\IP address\\backupfolder\'. For improved performance, it\'s recommended to use separate folder for each database to be migrated. You can provide the database level file share path by using the **Advanced Settings** option.
  **User name**                                   Make sure that the Windows user has full control privilege on the network share that you provided above. Azure Database Migration Service will impersonate the user credential to upload the backup files to Azure Storage container for restore operation. If using Azure File share, use the storage account name pre-pended with AZURE\\ as the username.
  **Password**                                    Password for the user. If using Azure file share, use a storage account key as the password.
  **Subscription of the Azure Storage Account**   Select the subscription that contains the Azure Storage Account.
  **Azure Storage Account**                       Select the Azure Storage Account that DMS can upload the backup files from the SMB network share to and use for database migration. We recommend selecting the Storage Account in the same region as the DMS service for optimal file upload performance.
